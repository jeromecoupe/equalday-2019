title: "Is disobedience a fundamental right?"
type: "Workshop"
location: "Flagey"

After a short presentation of the current legal framework of disobedience, we propose a co-construction workshop so as to make proposals jointly to clarify and extend this legal framework, or to reach the conclusion that it is not useful or opportune, and may even be dangerous. The conclusions of our reflections will be published after the event.

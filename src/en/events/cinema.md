By welcoming refugees, the inhabitants of the Roya Valley in the Alpes-Maritimes broke the law. The documentary "[The Valley](https://www.facebook.com/THEVALLEY.ROYA/)" chronicles their resistance to the brutality of a policy that is limited to the expulsion of these migrants. “Volunteers from the [Roya Citoyenne](https://www.roya-citoyenne.fr/) association became aware of the irregularities committed by the representatives of the state”.

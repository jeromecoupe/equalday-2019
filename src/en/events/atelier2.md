Is disobedience a fundamental right? Let’s explore law and disobedience together ... We offer two co-construction workshops: one to draft a legislative text to enshrine the right to disobedience, the other to draft a manifesto arguing that enshrining the right to disobedience is inappropriate and/or dangerous. Take your pick! Participate!
